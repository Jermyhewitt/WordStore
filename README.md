# WordStore
Simple vocabulary application that I created to store new words. The application automatically
fetches the definition and usage of a word from a website and adds it 
to the database so that it can be viewed later if wifi is unavailable.

- [x] View Definition and usage
- [x] Save word to database so that retrieval is faster in the future and no need for internet connectivity
